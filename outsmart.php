				<p>Outsmarts main focus after the re-brand was to re-engage with their audience. While their social media presence was good, we suggested TINT for an extra boost. By using the social aggregator platform on both their website and on billboards around the country they were able to inspire their community in an impaction way on a large scale.</p>
